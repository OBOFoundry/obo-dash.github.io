WARN	annotation_whitespace	CARO:0000042	rdfs:comment	"MH: define as not part of embryo, or will not develop into embryo? MH: changed def to exclude cells so this class could be included in gross anatomical part. DOS: Changed to something that I think works for both vertebrates and invertebrates and that keeps the restriction to multicellular structures.  Old def: \""Anatomical structure that is contiguous with the embryo and is comprised of portions of tissue that will not contribute to the embryo.\"".  One remaining question - perhaps zygote is too restrictive given that some organisms have parthenogenesis e.g. aphids?

WARN	annotation_whitespace	CARO:0001002	IAO:0000115	"A two dimensional anatomical structure that is the boundary between an anatomical structure and an anatomical substance, an anatomical space or the organism's environment.

WARN	annotation_whitespace	CARO:0001008	IAO:0000115	Anatomical structure that is part of a multicellular organism and is at the gross anatomical level, e.g. above the level of a cell.  Included are portions of organism substances such as blood, multi-cell-part structures such as axon tracts, acellular anatomical structures such as hair, and organism subdivisions such as head. Excluded is the whole organism and more granular parts of the organism, such as atoms, molecules, macromolecular complexes and cells. 
WARN	annotation_whitespace	CARO:0010004	rdfs:comment	A general term for organism that is agnostic about single cell vs multi-cellular.  Note that this is a subclass of 'anatomical structure', meaning that an organism must be a connected structure. For example, if I take one plant and make a rooted cutting from a it, I now have two (clonally related) organisms.
