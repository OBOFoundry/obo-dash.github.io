The two-level variable represents the response, and the other represents an explanatory variable with ordered levels. The null hypothesis is the hypothesis of no trend, which means that the binomial proportion is the same for all levels of the explanatory variable

For example, doses of a treatment can be ordered as 'low', 'medium', and 'high', and we may suspect that the treatment benefit cannot become smaller as the dose increases. The trend test is often used as a genotype-based test for case-control genetic association studies.

Another formulation is that it plots the event rate in the experimental (intervention) group against the event rate in the control group, as an aid to exploring the heterogeneity of effect estimates within a meta-analysis.
It is diagram used in meta-analysis that compares the risks observed in the experimental and control arms of clinical trials. Each trial is located in the space of a diagram where the sizes of the circles indicate the sizes of the trials. Trials in which the experimental treatment had a higher risk than the control will be in the upper left of the plot. If risk in the both groups is the same the circle will fall on the line of equality. If the control treatment has a higher risk than the experimental treatment then the point will be in the lower right of the plot. It is often used as an indicator of heterogeneity and hence as an indicator of the likelihood that results from different trials can be validly combined. Named after Kristin L'Abbé.

INFO	lowercase_definition	Funnel plot	IAO:0000115	<a Funnel plot is a scatter plot of treatment effect versus a measure of study size and aims to provide a visual aid to detecting bias or systematic heterogeneity. A symmetric inverted funnel shape arises from a ‘well-behaved’ data set, in which publication bias is unlikely. An asymmetric funnel indicates a relationship between treatment effect and study size. Known caveats: If high precision studies really are different from low precision studies with respect to effect size (e.g., due to different populations examined) a funnel plot may give a wrong impression of publication bias. The appearance of the funnel plot can change quite dramatically depending on the scale on the y-axis — whether it is the inverse square error or the trial size.Funnel plot was introduced by Light and Palmer in 1984.@en>

SSMD directly measures the magnitude of difference between two groups.
SSMD is widely used in High Content Screen for hit selection and quality control.

When the data is preprocessed using log-transformation as normally done in HTS experiments, SSMD is the mean of log fold change divided by the standard deviation of log fold change with respect to a negative reference.
