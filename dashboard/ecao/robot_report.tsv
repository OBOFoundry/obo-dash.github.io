WARN	annotation_whitespace	2-cell stage	IAO:0000115	An embryo that is composed of two cells and is surrounded by a fertilization envelope. The first cleavage plane took place meridionally (i.e. along the animal-vegetal axis), thereby generating two blastomeres of equal size, each containing both animal and vegetal cytoplasm. 
WARN	annotation_whitespace	4-cell stage	IAO:0000115	An embryo that is composed of four cells and is surrounded by a fertilization envelope. The second cleavage plane was meridional and perpendicular to the first one, thereby producing four blastomeres of equal size, each containing both animal and vegetal cytoplasm. 
WARN	annotation_whitespace	16-cell stage	IAO:0000115	An embryo that is composed of 16 cells and is surrounded by a fertilization envelope.  Note for euechinoid indirect developers: although the fourth cleavage occurred simultaneously in all cells, the pattern of cell division differed in the animal and vegetal blastomeres. In the animal hemisphere the four cells divided meridionally, producing eight blastomeres of equal volume arrayed in a single tier. These cells are called the mesomeres. In the vegetal hemisphere, the four cells underwent an unequal, equatorial cleavage, producing a tier of four large cells, the macromeres, and a tier of four small cells, the micromeres, located at the vegetal pole. At the 16-cell stage, the embryo is hence composed of three groups of cells with distinct sizes. In most sea urchin species,this is the first morphological indication of the animal-vegetal axis. 
WARN	annotation_whitespace	60-cell stage	IAO:0000115	An embryo that is composed of 60 cells and is surrounded by a fertilization envelope. Note for euechinoid indirect developers: The large micromeres have achieved a sixth cleavage, which was meridional, thereby generating a ring of 8 cells. At that stage, from the animal to the vegetal pole, the embryo is composed of: 16 an1-cells, 16 an2-cells, 8 veg1-cells, 8 veg2-cells, 8 large micromeres and 4 small micromeres.

WARN	annotation_whitespace	mid-blastula stage	IAO:0000115	The embryo is composed of about 300 cells and is surrounded by a fertilization envelope. Cell divisions are less synchronous than at earlier stages. The cells have  flattened slightly  on their inner (basal) surface, further contributing to the enlargement of the blastocoel. In some species, cells have started to form cilia on their outer surface. The embryo is still  spherical and does not display any obvious morphological landmarks that indicate the primary or secondary embryonic axes. Note for euechinoid indirect developers: molecular labeling typically indicates the presence of 16 to 32 large micromere descendant cells and 4 to 8 small micromere descendants at this stage .

WARN	annotation_whitespace	late swimming blastula stage	IAO:0000115	The embryo has started elongated along the animal-vegetal axis. Its vegetal region has further continued to thicken and it is marked by a characteristic 'V' shape formed by the blastocoel at the level of the cells constituting the vegetal plate, thereby pointing to the vegetal pole. At the animal pole, the embryo is characterized by the presence of an apical tuft.  
WARN	annotation_whitespace	late mesenchyme blastula stage	IAO:0000115	The skeletogenic primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) have migrated away from the vegetal plate by extending filopodia and moving along the blastocoel wall. The vegetal plate has flattened but has not started to invaginate. The apical pole domain still bears an apical tuft of long, non-motile cilia. 
WARN	annotation_whitespace	blastopore formation stage	oboInOwl:hasExactSynonym	 blastopore gastrula stage
WARN	annotation_whitespace	early gastrula stage	IAO:0000115	The embryo is mainly characterized morphologically by the presence in the blastocoel of a small archenteron (i.e. primitive digestive tract) that is about a third of its finally size. Following the initial invagination of the vegetal plate, the archenteron has slightly been extended, within the blastocoel, by the subsequent invagination of additional non-skeletogenic mesoderm cells and of some endoderm cells. In parallel, the skeletogenic mesenchyme cells (or SM cells, primary mesenchyme cells or PMC) have by now started migrating along the blastocoel wall, towards the animal pole, thereby creating two lateral chains (one left and one right), while around the developing archenteron, they have gathered into two ventrolateral clusters separated by an oral (or ventral) and an aboral (or dorsal) chain defined by the remaining skeletogenic mesenchyme cells. Within the oral and aboral skeletogenic mesenchyme chains, the cells have further started to fuse to form syncytial filopodial cables within which skeletal calcification will subsequently take place. At the animal pole, the animal neuroectoderm territory is still marked by an enlarged epithelium bearing long and immotile cilia.

WARN	annotation_whitespace	prism stage	IAO:0000115	The embryo is mainly characterized morphologically by a typical triangular shape, the beginning of the tripatition of the digestive tract and the presence of pigmented cells. The oral (or ventral) ectoderm has by now even more flattened, making an almost perfect right angle with the blastoporal side of the embryo. By contrast, on the opposite side, the aboral (or dorsal) ectoderm has round up and slightly elongated, thereby forming the primitive apex of the future larvae. These changes have conferred the embryo a typical and easy recognizable triangular shape. In the oral ectoderm, a small depression has further appeared, called the stomodeum, which will later fuse with the tip of the archenteron to form the mouth. In the blastocoel, the digestive tract has also by now bended toward the stomodeum and started to become tripartite. The cardiac sphincter has started forming, separating the future esophagus from the future stomach. The triradiate spicules have also continued elongating, thereby forming by now, towards the animal pole, the right and left dorsoventral connecting rods, towards the apex, the body rods, and along the vegetal, oral ectoderm the left and right ventral transverse rods. Moreover, some non-skeletogenic mesenchyme cells (or NSM cells, secondary mesenchyme cells or SMC) have started becoming pigmented and inserted into the aboral ectoderm. These cells represent part of the future immune system of the larvae along with other blastocoelar cells that are present in the blastocoel around the gut. In the vicinity of the future esophagus, other non-skeletogenic mesoderm descendant cells along with some endoderm cells have further arranged to form a single unpaired coelomic pouch. At the animal pole, the apical pole domain has also started to flatten making the embryo look like a square when viewed from the oral side, and it still arbors a tuft a long and immotile cilia. Finally, within the apical pole domain, but not yet in the ciliary band, molecular labeling surveys also start by this stage to reveal the presence of differentiating neuronal cells.

WARN	annotation_whitespace	early pluteus larva stage	IAO:0000115	The embryo is by now a fully formed pluteus larva. The mouth has opened and the digestive tract is becoming functional. On the ventral side, the mouth is surrounded anteriorly by an oral hood and posteriorly by two postoral arms. On the dorsal side, the apex has lengthened. The skeleton has indeed continued extending, expending the dorsoventral connecting rods, the body rods, and the ventral transverse rods as well as developing the anterolateral rods and the postoral rods. Within the larva, the tripartition of the digestive tract has further progressed. The cardiac sphincter is now fully formed in between the esophagus and the stomach, and the pyloric sphincter in between the stomach and the intestine and the anal sphincter at the level of the anus have also started forming. Around the esophagus, the coelomic pouch has further developed into two bilobed sacs (or pouches), one on each side of the digestive tract. Finally, within the apical pole domain, as well as within the ciliary band, differentiated neurons with their extended axons can also now be distinguished by immunostaining. In parallel, the apical tuft of long and immotile cilia remains discernable at the tip of the oral hood, while in parallel the ciliary band has further started growing a concentrated number of intermediate size motile cilia, which will be used by the larva to swim directionally.

WARN	annotation_whitespace	4-arm pluteus larva stage	IAO:0000115	The 4-arm pluteus larva is mainly characterized morphologically by the presence, on the ventral side, of four extended arms (two anterolateral arms at the level of the oral hood and two postoral arms) and on the dorsal side by a sleeked apex. The larva now possesses a completely tripartite and functional digestive tract composed of an esophagus, a stomach, and an intestine, respectively limited by a cardiac sphincter, a pyloric sphincter, and an anal sphincter. Around the esophagus, the right and left coelomic pouches have further started to grow in size and elongate. The first morphological indicator of a left-right asymmetry becomes apparent at that stage, the left coelomic pouch being slightly more elongated than the right one. Furthermore, a thin protrusion of non-skeletogenic mesenchyme cells can be seen extending from the left coelomic pouch to the anterior ectoderm. This is the primary pore canal, which opens to the exterior environment by the hydropore. The larva further now possesses, all around the esophagus, a network of contractile muscles allowing it to swallow and feed. Finally, the apical tuft previously observed at the animal pole has by now disappeared, leaving behind only the concentrated stretch of intermediate size cilia borne by the ciliary band.

WARN	annotation_whitespace	6-arm pluteus larva stage	IAO:0000115	The 6-arm pluteus larva is mainly characterized morphologically by the presence, on the ventral side, of six arms, and by the development, on the anterior midline of the esophagus, of the dorsal arch. The larva has indeed extended on the ventral side two additional posterodorsal arms and has developed on the anterior side an additional skeletal element called the dorsal arch. In addition, at the basis of the postoral and posterodorsal arms, four small patches of ciliary band have by now cut off and migrated toward the apex, forming four patches of ciliated structures called the epaulettes (one posterior and one anterior pair). The nervous system of the larva has also become more complex with cell bodies and axons being present all along the arms and for the latter as well throughout the apex. The left and right coelomic pouches have continued to elongate on each side of the digestive tract. As a note this stage is relatively fleeting. 
WARN	annotation_whitespace	competent pluteus larva stage	IAO:0000115	The competent pluteus larva is mainly characterized morphologically by the presence, on the ventral size, of still 8 arms and by the presence on the left side of the stomach of the rudiment that is now the size of or even bigger than the stomach. The rudiment further harbors by now five long primary podia (i.e. tube feet), five quartets of definitive spines located between the primary podia and five pairs of immature spines at the basis of the primary podia, while on the opposite side, i.e. on the right side of the larva, five to seven immature spines have further developed, supported by the genital plates, along with one to four pedicaellariae. At the level of the larva, in parallel, the anterior and posterior pairs of epaulettes have also considerably increased in size by now and even fused dorsally to the hydropore and to the anus respectively, thereby leaving exempt of cilia two lateral fields in between them. At the center of the left lateral field, the vestibular roof has also by now ruptured and this opening has created the vestibular pore, through which some primary podia of the rudiment protrude outside the larva and scrutinize the substrate looking for the adequate cues to begin metamorphosis. At that stage, the larva is thus exhibiting a typical substrate-test behavior, going to the sea bottom and scrutinizing the substrate. This behavior is characteristic of a larva named competent to metamorphosis, which it will accomplish providing that it is adequately stimulated by environmental factors.

WARN	annotation_whitespace	metamorphic larva stage	IAO:0000115	The metamorphic larva stage consists essentially of the evagination of the echinoid rudiment. It is characterized by the execution of conspicuous and relatively abrupt physical changes that take place quite quickly, in about one hour, and during which the planktonic larva is transformed into a benthic juvenile. At that stage, the larva is settled on the substrate and is firmly attached to it by the primary podia of the rudiment. The ectodermal epithelium of its arms has started to collapse, making the spicules supporting the larval arms piercing through the epidermis. The larval mouth and anus have further closed, while in parallel, within the larva, the rudiment spines have lifted up thereby distending the vestibular wall and wide opening the vestibular pore. Following these movements, the rudiment has farther down accomplished and finalized its complete eversion, encapsulating the digestive tract and reaching the right side of the larval body. During this process, the genital plates and the associated pedicellariae and immature spines present on the right side of the larva have further completed the production of the aboral part of the adult body. At the end of metamorphosis, hence at the end of the metamorphic larva stage, the individual has thus become benthic, it is settled in the substrate, and it looks like an adult pentaradial sea urchin although it is smaller in size, deprived of a functional digestive system and sexually immature.
