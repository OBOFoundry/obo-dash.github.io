WARN	annotation_whitespace	confocal laser scanning microscopy evidence	IAO:0000115	"A type of confocal microscopy evidence that results in an image that is built up pixel-by-pixel by collecting the emitted photons from the fluorophores in the sample by passing a laser beam through a light source aperture which is then focused by an objective lens into a small area on the surface of the sample.
