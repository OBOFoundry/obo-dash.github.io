ERROR	duplicate_definition	neural stem cell	IAO:0000115	Neural stem cells are the multipotent stem cells that generate nerve cells. However, since the early 1990s, neural stem cells have been isolated from the adult brain as well as fetal brain tissues. Stem cells in the adult brain are found in the areas called the subventricular zone and the ventricle zone. Another location of brain stem cells occurs in the hippocampus, a special structure of the cerebral cortex related to memory function. Stem cells isolated from these areas are able to divide and to give rise to nerve cells and neuron-supporting cell types in culture.
