Mycoplasma Broth Base (Frey) is used for the cultivation of avian mycoplasmas.Principles of the ProcedureMeat digests, peptones, beef extract and yeast extract provide the nitrogen, vitamins, amino acids and carbon in these media. Sodium chloride maintains the osmotic balance of these formulations. Agar, the solidifying agent, is used in PPLO (Mycoplasma) Agar at a concentration slightly reduced from usual to ensure formation of the largest possible colonies because the organisms grow into the agar with only slight surface growth.13The base media are supplemented with Mycoplasma Supplement or Mycoplasma Enrichment w/o Penicillin because Mycoplasma spp. are fastidious in their growth requirements. 14 Mycoplasma Supplement contains fresh yeast extract and horse serum. Yeast extract provides the preformed nucleic acid precursors that are required by Mycoplasma spp.14 Horse serum supplies cholesterol, a growth stimulant.14 Mycoplasma Enrichment without Penicillin is a selective enrichment containing the inhibitor thallium acetate, to which a penicillin of choice (penicillin G or a broad-spectrum semisynthetic penicillin) can be added at the time of use to make it selective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.FormulaeDifco™ PPLO AgarApproximate Formula* Per LiterBeef Heart, Infusion from 50 g..................................... 6.0 gPeptone..................................................................... 10.0 gSodium Chloride.......................................................... 5.0 gAgar.......................................................................... 14.0 gDifco™ PPLO BrothConsists of the the same ingredients without the agar.pH 7.8 ± 0.2BBL™ Mycoplasma Agar Base (PPLO Agar Base)Approximate Formula* Per LiterBeef Heart, Infusion from (solids).................................. 2.0 gPancreatic Digest of Casein.......................................... 7.0 gBeef Extract.................................................................. 3.0 gYeast Extract................................................................ 3.0 gSodium Chloride.......................................................... 5.0 gAgar.......................................................................... 14.0 gpH 7.8 ± 0.2BBL™ Mycoplasma Broth Base (PPLO Broth Base)Consists of the same ingredients without the agar.BBL™ Mycoplasma Broth Base (Frey)Approximate Formula* Per LiterPancreatic Digest of Casein.......................................... 7.5 gPapaic Digest of Soybean Meal..................................... 2.5 gYeast Extract................................................................ 5.0 gSodium Chloride.......................................................... 5.0 gPotassium Chloride...................................................... 0.4 gMagnesium Sulfate...................................................... 0.2 gDisodium Phosphate.................................................... 1.6 gMonopotassium Phosphate.......................................... 0.1 gpH 7.7 ± 0.2Difco™ Mycoplasma SupplementApproximate Formula* Per 30 mL VialYeast Extract................................................................ 0.09 gHorse Serum.............................................................. 22.8 mLBBL™ Mycoplasma Enrichment without PenicillinApproximate Formula* Per 30 mL VialHorse Serum.............................................................. 20.0 mLYeast Extract (fresh autolysate)................................... 10.0 mLThallium Acetate........................................................ 50.0 mg*Adjusted and/or supplemented as required to meet performance criteria.>

The pH should be adjusted to 7.1 prior to autoclaving (7). After the medium is autoclaved at 121°C for 15 minutes, a filter sterilized solution of 10% solution of carbohydrate (6, 8) is aseptically added to the medium to a final concentration of 1%. The sterile medium containing the carbohydrate is aliquoted aseptically into sterile test tubes and cooled unslanted as stabs (5). Some procedures call for the addition of 10 g/liter of carbohydrate to the medium prior to sterilization. The medium is then dissolved by heating to a boil on a hot plate or by steaming for 20 minutes prior to aliquoting into test tubes. The tubed medium is then steamed for 20 minutes in place of autoclaving to prevent breaking down of the carbohydrate (7).

MacConkey Agar is used for isolating and differentiating lactose-fermenting from lactose-nonfermenting gram-negative enteric bacilli.Principles of the ProcedurePeptones are sources of nitrogen and other nutrients. Yeast extract is a source of trace elements, vitamins, amino acids and carbon. Lactose is a fermentable carbohydrate. When lactose is fermented, a local pH drop around the colony causes a color change in the pH indicator (neutral red) and bile precipitation. Bile salts, bile salts no. 3, oxgall and crystal violet are selective agents that inhibit growth of gram-positive organisms. Sodium chloride maintains osmotic balance in the medium.

The current formulation incorporated these later modifications: The primary value of Loeffler medium is in the growth and morphological characterization of members of the genus Corynebacterium. This formulation enhances the formation of metachromatic granules within the cells of the organisms. Due to its serum content, Loeffler medium can be used for the determination of proteolytic activities of microorganisms. The gray-white surface of the medium provides an excellent background for the detection and observation of colonial pigmentation. If all extraneous moisture is removed aseptically from the slants and the upper part of the slant is heated until the slant ruptures, this medium can be used for the detection of ascospores.Principles of the procedureHeart muscle and animal tissue peptone provide the amino acids and other complex nitrogenous substances necessary to support growth of corynebacteria. Sodium chloride supplies essential ions.Dextrose is a source of fermentable carbohydrate. The eggs and beef serum cause the medium to coagulate during the sterilization process and are sources of protein which are used for metabolism of the corynebacteria and other organisms.Approximate formula 	 Per liter purified waterBeef serum 	 70.0 gHeart muscle, infusion from (solids) 	0.72 gPeptic digest of animal tissue 	 0.71 gSodium chloride 	 0.36 gDextrose 	 0.71 gEgg (whole, dried) 	 7.5 g>"
