ERROR	multiple_definitions	intent-to-treat analysis	IAO:0000115	An inferential statistical data analysis that  includes all randomized patients in the groups to which they were randomly assigned. The intent-to-treat analysis  is based on the initial treatment assignment and not on the treatment eventually received.  ITT analysis includes every subject who is randomized according to randomized treatment assignment. It ignores noncompliance, protocol deviations, withdrawal, and anything that happens after randomization.

WARN	annotation_whitespace	Patterns from Gene Expression software	IAO:0000115	"A software that can be used to produce lists of differentially expressed genes with confidence measures attached. These lists are generated via a False Discovery Rate (FDR) method of controlling the false positives. Patterns from Gene Expression (PaGE) is more than a differential expression analysis tool.  PaGE is a tool to attach descriptive, dependable, and easily interpretable expression patterns to genes across multiple conditions, each represented by a set of replicated array experiments. 
"
WARN	annotation_whitespace	Patterns from Gene Expression software	IAO:0000116	The input consists of (replicated) intensities from a collection of array experiments from two or more conditions (or from a collection of direct comparisons on 2-channel arrays). The output consists of patterns, one for each row identifier in the data file. One condition is used as a reference to which the other types are compared. The length of a pattern equals the number of non-reference sample types. The symbols in the patterns are integers, where positive integers represent up-regulation as compared to the reference sample type and negative integers represent down-regulation. The patterns are based on the false discovery rates for each position in the pattern, so that the number of positive and negative symbols that appear in each position of the pattern is as descriptive as the data variability allows. The patterns generated are easily interpretable in that integers are used to represent different levels of up- or down-regulation as compared to the reference sample type.
